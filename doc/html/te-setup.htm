<p id="contentheader">TE Essential Configuration and Setup</p>
<p>
The following describe the TE environment as it is organized in GIT HUB.</br>
The project contains files that should allow to run the components out of the box after a successfull build.
</p>
<p><b>Development</b></p>
<p>The TE is a 100% Java implementation. Java version 16 has used. There a couple of places Java <i>records</i> has been used.
Besides that the code should be java 1.8 complaint.</br></br>
IntelliJ (2021.2.3) has been used ISE when developing the code. The building tool used has been Gradle 7.3.3</br></br>
And obviously, GIT HUB is used as source repository.
</br></br>
There are no dependencies to any third party products. However I have included a couple of Auxillary libraries that I frequently uses.
These are found under the <i>libs</i> directory in the project (they should be public and found under the Hoddmimes GIT HUB).</br></br>
</p>
<p><b>Building</b></p>
<p>
After the project has been cloned, it should be built. If using IntelliJ, open the Gradle window and execute "build" undet the top level
i.e under <i>TradingEngine</i>. You may also build the project from a console window using Gradle, do so by;
<ul>
    <li>set default to the <i>TradingEngine</i> directory</li>
    <li>execute the gradle command: <i>gradle build</i></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p id="contentheader">Components</p>

<p>The project contains four runnable components:
<ul>
    <li><b>Trading Eninge</b> the accual market market place.</li>
    <li><b>Management</b> a GUI application for monitoring and controlling the TE</li>
    <li><b>Trading Client</b> simple application for testing / excersing the TE REST and WEB socket API</li>
    <li><b>Trade Reports</b> application for creating trade reports..</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>TradingEngine</b></p>
<p>The script file in the directory <i>./bin</i> te.sh (Linux) or te.bat (Windows)  will start the TE using the configuration
in the file <i>./configuration/TeConfiguration.json</i></br>
The TE application will load market and instrument definitions from the file <i>./configuration/InstrumentDefinitions.json</i></br>
Account / User definitions are loaded from the file <i>./configuration/AccountDefinitions.json</i></br></br>

Logfiles, default the TE is configured to create a logfile under the <i>./logs</i> directory i.e. <i>./logs/TradingEngine.log</i> (appended).
The TE used Log4J for logging and the logging configuration is controlled by the LOG4J confuturation file "./configuration/log4j2.xml
    </br></br>
    The TE also log all incomming <i>request</i> and <i>responses</i> to a seprate log file, <i>./logs/TeMessagesLog-&lt;yyyy_MM_dd_HHmmss&gt.json</i>
    </br></br>
    Furthermore all execution i.e. trades are written to a separate trade logfile, configured to <i>./logs/trades-&lt;yyMMdd-HHmmssSSS&gt;.txl</i>
    Persistence of trade excutions are most importance since they will result in a monetarily settlement. Therefor trade records are written synchronosly
    and on (disk) block boundary with records start / end markers to guarantee a all or nothing execution.<br>
    With the application <i>TE tradee broser</i> trades can be extracted from <i>txl</i> logfiles and be written to a more readable format i.e. Excel,Json or HTML.
</p>
<p><b>Management</b></p>
<p>Is a basic Swing application for administrating and monitoring the TE setup.
The <i>management</i> application connects to the TE components. If the TE is not running teh management app will wait until the TE is started.</br>
The application will when starting declare it self as a listener on the multicast group and port which is used by the TE to anounce its service points.
    The MC address and port used by the TE is found in the TE configuration file, normally <i>./configuration/TeConfiguration.json</i>
    This implicates that the management application must run on the same LAN as the TE components in order to discover TE management services.

The application provides interfaces for:
<ul>
    <li><i>Configuration</i>, displays the TE service sercvice points being available / online.</li>

    <li><i>Markets</i>, display configurade markets. In this view its possible to change the market state and market shedule. <i>Note!</i> changes are only volatile. To change schedule
    permanently the instrument defition file must be edited, which normally is <li>./configuration/InstrumentDefinition.json</i></li>

    <li><i>Symbols</i>, display the tradeable symbols defined. In the view it is possible to change the state of a symbol i.e. suspend / unsuspend. <i>Note!</i> changes are volatile.</li>

    <li><i>Accounts</i>, in this view it is possible to define new accounts, remove accounts and update accounts (i.e. password). Changes to accounts are permanent and persisted. </li>

    <li><i>Ordes</i>, display active orders in the market, per account. In this view it is possible (on behalf) to delete a specific or or all orders for an account.</li>

    <li><i>Trades</i>, display trades done, per account. In this view it's also possible to <i>revert</i> a trade. Reverting a trade will create a counter trade to neutralize the position.</li>

    <li><i>MsgLog</i>, the TE will by default log all request and responses to a message log. In this view it is possible to view the message interaction with the clients. The view
        also provides an interface for searching in the message logs. Search crietrias are:
        <ul>
            <li>Account</li>
            <li>Date</li>
            <li>Time</li>
            <li>Free text, (regex)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><i>Statistics</i> displays statistics for the TE components.
    <ul>
        <li>Sessions, display active sessions, total request, max sessions and total failure requests.</li>
        <li>Matcher, display order book essentials, totoal add,delet,amend requests and max order rates.</li>
        <li>Trades>, display trade statistics per market and symbol.</li>
        <li>Market Data, displays active market data subscriptiond, total broadcast per type a max broadcast rates.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


The script file in <i>./bin/management.sh</i> (Linux) and <i>./bin/management.bat</i> will start the <i>management</i> application.
</p>
</br></br>
<p><b>Trading Client</b></p>
<p>
Is basic console application connecting to the trading engine. The application reads a <i>command file</i> with
requests to be sent to the TE. The command file configured to be used is <i>./configuration/ClientTestScript.json</i>.</br>
The script file in <i>./bin/client.sh</i> (Linux) and <i>./bin/client.bat</i> will start the <i>Test</i> Client application.
</br></br>
</p>

<p><b>Trade Reports</b></p>
<p>Is basic Swing application application for viewing and extracting trades from <i>txl</i> logfiles.
Besides viewing trades they can be extracted to readable files i.e. HTML, Excel and Json formatted.</br>
The script file in <i>./bin/trades.sh</i> (Linux) and <i>./bin/trades.bat</i> will start the <i>Trade</i> viewer application.
</p></br>

<p><i><b>This is the essential to get things going. The rest is in the source, nothing fancy or complicated.
If you have some basic developer and Java knowledge the whole project should be a fairly straight forward thing.
